# Quack

A templated C++ implementation of the Quack (Queue + Stack) ADT using 2 std::vectors

### Interface: 

`void push(item)`: Push an item to the stack

`type pop()`: Pop item from top of stack

`type dequeue()`: Get the first item from the queue

`bool empty()`: Checks if the Quack is empty

### Files in this Repo: 

`quack.hpp`: Header file with function and class declarations

`quack-private.hpp`: Source code for Quack ADT

`Makefile`: Build the experiment

`Experiment.cpp`: Runs a small experiment to test the speed of the quack vs std::queue. Usage: `./experiment n numTrials`


### Asymtotic Runtime (n items in quack): 

`push(item)`: $\Theta(1)$ worst case

`pop()`: $\Theta(n)$ worst case, $\Theta(1)$ amortized

`dequeue()`: $\Theta(n)$ worst case, $\Theta(1)$ amortized

### Run Time Experiment:
To see how this compares to the std::queue library. I did 4 tests with n = 10000000 (30 trials):
- Experiment 1: Push n items to the quack/queue
- Experiment 2: Push n items to quack/queue. Pop all n items afterwards
- Experiment 3: Push n items to the quack/queue. Dequeue all n items. (This triggers the $\Theta(n)$ worst case for the Quack most frequently)
- Experiment 4: Push n items to the quack/queue. Alternate between Dequeuing and popping n/2 times.
